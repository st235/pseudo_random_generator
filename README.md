# Pseudo Random Generators (__PRG__)

This project was created for educational purposes and handles various pseudo random
generation methods. Currently there are a lot of things
needs to be done as I explore the wonderful world of numeric methods.
I really like to quote [Steve Jobs from Stanford University speech](https://youtu.be/D1R-jKKp3NA?t=848):
"Stay hungry, stay foolish!", - it leads me to new discoveries.
